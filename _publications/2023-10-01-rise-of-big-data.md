**Abstract**

The chapter aims to establish a conceptual link between Industry 4.0 (IR 4.0), big data, data science, and sustainable tourism. It uses a grounded theory and conceptual approach. The findings indicate a significant increase in the use of big data in the tourism sector, particularly in business, governance, and research. The article also highlights institutions that are promoting the use of big data and data science for sustainable tourism. The author suggests that the interlinkage of these concepts provides a valuable resource for various stakeholders.
