Overall structure of the website?
✦ Of course. This directory is a classic setup for a personal academic or portfolio website using a tool called Jekyll.

  The key idea behind Jekyll is that you don't have to write complex HTML. Instead, you write your content in a simple text format called
  Markdown (.md files), and Jekyll automatically builds the final website for you.

  Here’s a breakdown of the most important parts for you as a data scientist:

  Where Your Content Lives

  You will spend most of your time in these folders. To add new content, you simply add a new file to the correct folder.

   * _config.yml: Your main settings file. You edit this to change your name, site title, email, social media links, and other global
     settings.
   * _posts/: For your blog posts. To write a new post, you create a file here named YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md.
   * _publications/: For your academic papers. You add each paper as a separate .md file here. The template is designed to format them nicely.
   * _talks/: For your presentations and talks. Similar to publications, you add each talk as a .md file.
   * _teaching/: For courses you've taught.
   * _pages/: For static pages like your "About Me" (about.md) or "CV" (cv.md).
   * _data/: This holds structured data. For example, navigation.yml controls the links in your site's main menu. cv.json likely holds the
     data for your CV page, which you can edit directly.

  The "Front-End" Stuff (What you can mostly ignore)

  These folders control the look and feel of your site. You generally won't need to touch these unless you want to make significant design
  changes.


   * _layouts/ & _includes/: These are HTML templates that define the structure of your pages.
   * _sass/ & assets/: These folders control the styling (colors, fonts, layout) and hold assets like images or CSS files.

  The Generated Website (Do Not Touch!)


   * _site/: This is important. This folder contains the final, generated website that people see. You should never edit files in this
     directory directly, because Jekyll will delete and rewrite everything in it every time it builds the site.

  What You Can Do (Common Tasks)

  Based on this structure, here are things I can help you with:


   1. Add a new publication, blog post, or talk.
   2. Update your CV by editing _data/cv.json or _pages/cv.md.
   3. Change your bio or social media links in _config.yml.
   4. Add a new page (like a "Projects" or "Contact" page).
   5. Change the navigation menu.
