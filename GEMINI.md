When asked to find ResearchGate links for publications, the following approach should be taken:

1.  List all the files in the `_publications` directory.
2.  For each file, extract the title of the publication.
3.  Use a search engine to search for the title on ResearchGate.
4.  If a matching publication is found, verify that it is the correct one by comparing the title, authors, and publication date.
5.  If the publication already has a `researchgateurl`, verify that the URL is correct.
6.  If the publication does not have a `researchgateurl`, add it to the file.
7.  If no matching publication is found, it is likely a placeholder file and can be ignored.
